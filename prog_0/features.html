    <h2>Overview of Features</h2>
    <p>
        This assignment involves creating a canvas in which 
        the user can create a poly-line by left clicking
        on a HTML5 Canvas. My implementation is quite simple,
        it first starts out by initializing an event
        listener for when the user pushes their mouse down.
        Then, it draws the first red and green lines that
        are seen in the design specification. The drawing
        itself is handled by the drawPoint function, which 
        takes one argument: e, which is an event listener.
        If the user has not created any points yet, it
        initializes the first line using the moveTo() function. 
        Then, for every point after that, it creates a line, and
        starts the next line at the ending point of the previous line.

        One of the more complex parts of this assignment was
        calculating the offset. This is because the mousedown
        event listener can only return the position mouse relative
        to the entire screen. However, the canvas does not take up
        the entire screen. To account for this, I found the difference
        between the cursor's position and the starting points of the
        canvas. This returns the position of the cursor relative to the 
        canvas as opposed to the screen.
