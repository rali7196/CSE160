            This program is a demonstration of three.js and some of its capabilities. To use this program, you can use the slider to
            spin the camera around the abstract art that I have created. The scene features a spinning cube, a sphere, and point
            lighting. 
            <p></p>
            To run this program, you first
            need to install Node.js, a common package manager for web development. <a href="https://nodejs.org/">You can find 
            it here</a> Once you install nodejs, you need to verify it is working on your system by typing node -v. Once you
            have accomplished this, you need to then install three js and vite. To do so, you need to run the following commands:
            First, try to run 
            <pre><code>npx vite</code></pre>
            Then, click on the url in your terminal. If that doesn't work, try the following steps:
            <p></p>
            <pre><code>npm install --save three</code></pre>
            <p>and</p>
            <pre><code>npm install vite</code></pre>
            <p>Then, in your terminal, run </p>
            <pre><code>npx vite</code></pre>
            If the above steps, don't work, here is a picture of what the program should look like:
