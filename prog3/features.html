    <h2>Overview of Features</h2>
    <p>
        This assignment contains 2 canvases: you draw on the left one and the output shows on the right one.
        You can use the drop down menu to select which kind of shading option you would like to use. Additionally,
        You can use the check boxes to check which kinds of lighting you would like to use, those being the directional
        light source and the point light source. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This assignment largely involved using the library from the textbook, as well as the provided examples, in order to 
        render a point light source and smooth shading. To implement the smooth shading algorithms, I used gourand shading, where
        I calculate the color at each vertex as opposed for each polygon. This resulted in a much smoother gradient
