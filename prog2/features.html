    <h2>Overview of Features</h2>
    <p>
        This assignemnt involved taking the output from the previous assignment and 
        revolving it around the z axis in the three dimensional plane. In order to do this,
        I took all the points from the user's 2d drawing, and then used trigonometry
        to calculate where each point would be if I rotated it by theta degrees. Then,
        using WebGL, I was able to successfully render the object. I did this by strategically
        splitting the points into arrays that WebGL could parse via its drawarrays() function. 
        What this function does is it takes an array of vertices, and a drawing mode,
        and then it simply draws the vertices. This function proved to be very useful in rendering
        my shape.

        One of the more complex parts of this assignment was learning how to use WebGL.
        In particular, I found writing all of the setup code for WebGL to be especially difficult
        due to how unfamiliar I was with it. Despite this, I learned a lot about how webGL works, and how 
        all of the boilerplate code is used to setup the drawarrays() function. Additionally,
        I found the concept of vertex shaders and fragment shaders to be particularly interesting.
